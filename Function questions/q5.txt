#create a function called InRange(num1,num2,num3)
#take in 3 numbers
#num2 will always be smaller than num3
#the function should return true or false based on if num1 is between num2 and num3
#must be done with a for loop(not cheating)

#hints
#use a for loop

#user examples:
#ans = InRange(1,-2,3)
#ans = True
#this is true because 1 is between -2 and 3

#ans = InRange(1,5,7)
#ans = False
#this is False because 1 is not between 5 and 7

#ans = InRange(100,5,3000)
#ans = True
#this is True because 100 is between 5 and 3000
