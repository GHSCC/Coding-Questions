#write a function named allsum
#that takes in 2 numbers(number1 will always be smaller than number2)
#return the sum of all the numbers from the first number to the second number

#user examples:
#ans1 = allsum(1,4)
#ans1 = 1+2+3+4 = 10

#ans2 = allsum(10,12)
#ans2 = 10+11+12 = 33

#ans3 = subtract(0,3)
#ans3 = 0+1+2+3 = 6
