#how to use dictionaries
#making a dictionary
dictionary = {}
#if you want it to have predefined values, here's an example
#note that a dictionary can use strings, numbers and booleans as it's index, and it can store any basic data type, like arrays, another dictionary, number, etc
dictionary2 = {"key1":0,2:2}

#how to access things within the dictionary
#output_value = dictionary_name[dictionary_key]
#hint: the key must be valid in order for it to work
ouput_value = dictionary2["key1"]
print(ouput_value)

#why doesn't this work?
ouput_value = dictionary2[1]
print(ouput_value)

#how to add values to a dictionary
#let's take out created empty dictionary, and add a value of ["ivan","loves","vodka"] with the key of "ivan_data"
#dictionary_name[new_key] = new_value
dictionary["ivan_data"] = ["ivan","loves","vodka"]

#dictionary = {"ivan_data":["ivan","loves","vodka"]}

#how to delete something in a dictionary
#let's say we don't want the "ivan_data" in our dictionary anymore
#dictionary_name.pop(removed_key), this function also returns the popped values, which you can collect using a variable, if you don't collect it, you just delete the key
popped_value = dictionary.pop("ivan_data")

#dictionary = {}
#popped_value = ["ivan","loves","vodka"]

#how to check if a key is in the dictionary
if "keyname" in dictionary.keys():
  print(True)
