# Give the user instructions on how to play the game.

# Before game begins:
#  1. Ask user for the word

# Start Game:
#   1. Ask user for the letter they're going to guess.
#   2. If letter is included in the word, the letter is displayed in the correct spot the rest is filled with '#'
#   3. Repeat these steps until the word is guessed, or until the number of times guessed is more than (length of word + 3)
#                if the user didn't guess the word correctly in less than (length of word + 3) tries, print "LOSER!!"

# End Game:
#   1. Game ends when user guesses the word correctly.
#   2. If user wins, display "you win!"

#user_word = "hello"
