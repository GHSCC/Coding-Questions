#assignment #5
#skills involved: usage of classes and functions

#you are a very unpaid programer, who is currently told to code the class of an item
#the item is a part of a very cool rpg game
#your boss clearly states that the item should have these several values
#durability(int), damage(int),name(string)
#he wants you to write 3 functions for the item class
#get_durability(self): returns the integer of the durability left in the weapon
#use_durability(self): minuses the durability by 1, if it goes below 0, make it remain 0, instead of going to a negative int
#get_damage(self): return the damage value
#get_name(self): returns the name of the item

#if you  are stuck on any of these, either search up an example of a python class online or ask frank
