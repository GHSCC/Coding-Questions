Assignment #4 Operation stop the scammers
Jeff Benzos is currently facing some huge problems:
#1. His can’t spend as fast as he earns
#2. People are using scamming techniques to get free amazon packages(WHEN THEY AREN’T FREE)
We will be writing a program to solve the #2 problem today.
The scammer do this by exploiting the package not delivered feature, they would take pay for a product, then when it arrives, take the product, and report to amazon that the package wasn’t delivered, getting the refund on their products.
The program aims to strike back, by flagging their account, info and address.
Everytime the program runs, the user will be asked to do one of 2 actions, either 1.flagging an address, or 2. Checking if an address is flagged

Sample:
Computer:what would you like to do 1 or 2?
User: 1
Computer:what is the new address to be flagged
User:410 Terry Ave North Seattle
Computer: flagging successful
Computer:what would you like to do 1 or 2?
User: 2
Computer:what’s the address that you’re checking?
User: 410 Terry Ave. North Seattle
Computer: that address is flagged
Computer:what would you like to do 1 or 2?
User: 2
Computer:what’s the address that you’re checking?
User: 123432
