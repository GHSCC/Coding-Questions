#frank question #6
#asks the user for an number
#premade_list = [-10,0,40,50,20]
#multiply everything in a premade array by a number the user gives you(all of the elements in the array will be integers)
#print out the entire list after converting as output
#this question must be done with a loop(no cheekly web answers)

#hints and tips
#There are no hints for this one

#examples:
#user_input = 0
#[0,0,0,0,0]

#user_input = 5
#[-50,0,200,250,100]

#user_input = -2
#[20,0,-80,-100,-40]
