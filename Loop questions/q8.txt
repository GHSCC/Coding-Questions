#happy frank's question #8
#this is due on monday have fun

#a list is created in the code(only numbers are in the list)
#loops through the list
#if any number divided by 2 is equal to 5
#print out True

#list = [0]
#computer_output = Nothing(don't actually print nothing just showing that there is no output)

#list = [4,3,56,765,10]
#computer_output = True
#it's true since 10 divided by 2 is 5 which fits the requirement

#list = [4,3,56,765,2394872,234,32,56]
#computer_output = Nothing(don't actually print nothing just showing that there is no output)
#computer_output = Nothing(since none of the number/2 is equal to 5)
