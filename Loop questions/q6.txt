#happy frank's question #6
#this is due on friday have fun

#user enters a number
#computer prints 10 if it is within the range of 0 to number+4

#user_input = 0
#computer_output = literally nothing
#because 10 is not in from 0 to 4
#user_input = 5
#computer_output = literally nothing
#because 10 is not in from 0 to 9
#user_input = 8
#computer_output = 10
#because 10 is in from 0 to 12
